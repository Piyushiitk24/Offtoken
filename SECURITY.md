## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email the maintainer directly with details
3. Allow time for investigation and resolution
4. We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets**:
   - API keys
   - Passwords
   - Private keys
   - Tokens
   - Connection strings

2. **Use environment variables**:
   - Store secrets in `.env` files
   - Use the provided `.env.example` template
   - Environment files are automatically ignored by git

3. **Run security scans**:
   ```bash
   python3 security_scan.py
   ```

4. **Pre-commit hooks**:
   - Hooks automatically run security checks
   - Set up with: `./setup_security.sh`

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Secure your environment**:
   - Use virtual environments
   - Don't run as root/administrator
   - Keep your OS and Python updated

3. **Data privacy**:
   - All processing happens locally
   - No data is sent to external services
   - Temporary files are automatically cleaned

## Security Features

### Implemented Protections

- ✅ Comprehensive `.gitignore` for sensitive files
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks with secret scanning
- ✅ High-entropy string detection
- ✅ Environment variable templates
- ✅ Local-only processing (no external API calls)
- ✅ Automatic temporary file cleanup
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization

### File Security

- **Uploaded files**: Processed in temporary directories, automatically deleted
- **Text processing**: No persistent storage of user content
- **Tokenization**: All processing happens locally using `tiktoken`

### Privacy Guarantees

- **No telemetry**: No usage data collection
- **No external calls**: No internet connectivity required after setup
- **No logging**: User content is not logged or stored
- **No tracking**: No analytics or user behavior tracking
